Qualcomm SPMI arbiter/bus driver

This is bus driver for Qualcomm chips that use SPMI to communicate with PMICs.
The SPMI PMIC Arbiter is found on Snapdragon chipsets. It is an SPMI
controller with wrapping arbitration logic to allow for multiple on-chip
devices to control a single SPMI master.

Required properties:
- compatible: "qcom,spmi-pmic-arb"
- reg: Register block adresses and sizes for various parts of device:
   1) PMIC arbiter core registers
   2) SPMI configuration registers
   3) SPMI read command (observer) registers
- reg-names: "core", "cnfg", "obsrvr" for corresponding reg values

Optional properties (if not set by parent):
- #address-cells: 0x1 - childs slave ID address
- #size-cells: 0x1

All PMICs should be placed as a child nodes of bus arbiter.
Automatic detection of childs is currently not supported.

Example:

spmi@fc4cf000 {
	compatible = "qcom,spmi-pmic-arb";
	reg = <0xfc4cf000 0x1000>,
	      <0xfc4cb000 0x1000>,
	      <0xfc4ca000 0x1000>;
	reg-names = "core", "cnfg", "obsrvr";
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <1>;
};
